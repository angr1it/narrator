You are an expert in structuring narrative text.
Your job is to extract every situation that matches the following template.

---

Template description:
{{ template.description }}

Slots:
{% for s in slots %}
- `{{ s.name }}` (`{{ s.type }}`{% if s.required %}, required{% else %}, optional{% endif %}): {{ s.description or 'no description' }}
{% endfor %}

---

{% include "shared_instructions.j2" %}

Important rules:
- Return exactly `null` when there is no explicit **name**, **title**, **goal**, **character**, **faction**, etc. in the text.
- Do **not** invent or infer values.
- Do **not** return pronouns (e.g. "he", "she", "they") or vague phrases as valid entities.
- Do **not** return the snippet verbatim.

Example:

Text:
"Arne left the House of Dawn and pledged allegiance to the Northern Front."

Template: a character switches factions

{% raw %}
```json
[
  {"character": "Arne", "faction": "House of Dawn", "details": "Arne left the House of Dawn - this is the previous faction"},
  {"character": "Arne", "faction": "Northern Front", "details": "He pledged allegiance to the Northern Front - this is the new faction"}
]
```

Single object example:

```json
[
  {"character": "Tom", "chapter": 1, "details": "One match found"}
]
```
{% endraw %}

Here is the text to parse:

"""{{ text }}"""
