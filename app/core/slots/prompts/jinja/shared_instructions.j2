Response format:
- The answer is a **JSON array** of objects. Always return an array even if only one object is found.
- No text or explanations outside of JSON.
- Follow this schema strictly:
{{ format_instructions }}

Important: when filling any slots, extract names, objects and other entities in their **base (lemmatized, nominative) form**.
For example, from the phrase "Masha looked at Maksim" you should return `Maksim` and not `Maksima`, regardless of the case used in the text.
Always answer in the language of the input text.
If the text lacks information for a slot, return `null` for that field and do not guess.

Important rules:
- Return exactly `null` when there is no explicit **name**, **title**, **goal**, **character**, **faction**, etc. in the text.
- Do **not** invent or infer values.
- Do **not** return pronouns (e.g. "he", "she", "they") or vague phrases as valid entities.
- Do **not** return the snippet verbatim.
