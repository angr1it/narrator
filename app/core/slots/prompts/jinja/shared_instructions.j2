Response format:
- The answer is a **JSON array** of objects. Always return an array even if only one object is found.
- No text or explanations outside of JSON.
- Follow this schema strictly:
{{ format_instructions }}

Important: when filling any slots, extract names, objects and other entities in their **base (lemmatized, nominative) form**.
For example, from the phrase "Masha looked at Maksim" you should return `Maksim` and not `Maksima`, regardless of the case used in the text.
Always answer in the language of the input text.
