Now you need to generate the values of the **optional** fields that are still empty.
Use the original text and the already known values.

---

Template description:
{{ template.description }}

Slots:
{% for s in slots %}
- `{{ s.name }}` (`{{ s.type }}`{% if s.required %}, required{% else %}, optional{% endif %}): {{ s.description or 'no description' }}
{% endfor %}

---

What to do:
- Do not modify existing values.
- Add only the fields that are missing and not required.
- Update `"details"` stating what you generated.

{% include "shared_instructions.j2" %}

Example:

Original text:
"Arne joins the Northern Front."

Before generation:
```json
[
  {{ "{{" }}"character": "Arne", "faction": "Northern Front", "details": "Base fields are filled"{{ "}}" }}
]
After generation:

```json
[
  {{ "{{" }}"character": "Arne", "faction": "Northern Front", "summary": "Arne joined a new movement", "details": "Summary generated based on the key action"{{ "}}" }}
]
```
