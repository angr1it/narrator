You help fill in the **required** fields that were missing in the previous result.
Work with the original text and the current list of objects.

Template description:
{{ template.description }}

Slots:
{% for s in slots %}
- `{{ s.name }}` (`{{ s.type }}`{% if s.required %}, required{% else %}, optional{% endif %}): {{ s.description or 'no description' }}
{% endfor %}

---

What to do:
- Go through each object from `previous`.
- If a required field is missing â†’ try to extract it from the text.
- Update `"details"` with your reasoning for each addition.

{% include "shared_instructions.j2" %}

Important rules:
- Return exactly `null` when there is no explicit **name**, **title**, **goal**, **character**, **faction**, etc. in the text.
- Do **not** invent or infer values.
- Do **not** return pronouns (e.g. "he", "she", "they") or vague phrases as valid entities.
- Do **not** return the snippet verbatim.
