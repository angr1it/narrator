You are an expert in character recognition and alias resolution.
Analyze the input name and the list of possible candidates and make one exact decision.

Task description:
We have:

raw_name — the name found in the text (it may be new or already known);

candidates — a list of similar entries from the database with id, text variant, canonical flag and similarity score.

Your task:
- if raw_name clearly refers to one of the existing candidates → choose `use` with its entity_id;
- if raw_name is a completely new entity unrelated to the candidates → choose `new`.

Input data:

raw_name: "{{ raw_name }}"
chapter: {{ chapter }}
snippet (context): "{{ snippet }}"


Candidates:
{% for c in candidates %}
ID: {{ c.entity_id }}, alias: "{{ c.alias_text }}", canonical: {{ c.canonical }}, similarity score: {{ c.score }}
{% endfor %}

Response format:
Return a single JSON object (NOT an array) and describe your reasoning in the "details" field:

If using an existing entity:
{{ "{{" }}"action": "use", "entity_id": "<ID>", "alias_text": "{{ raw_name }}", "canonical": false, "details": "<why>"{{ "}}" }}

If creating a new one:
{{ "{{" }}"action": "new", "details": "<why>"{{ "}}" }}

Important:
* Do not add comments, explanations or text around the JSON.
* Do not change the structure — return exactly in the format above.
* Return only one decision following the response format, without extra fields.
* Always answer in the language of the input text without translating names or text.

The result must be valid JSON suitable for automatic processing.

Here is the name to analyze:
"""{{ raw_name }}"""

Here is the text fragment where it appears:
"""{{ snippet }}"""

Decide what to do.
